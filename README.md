Welcome to the 2018 REU Summer Student Program!

This repository was created to manage the work for the student project: 

**Machine Learning for the Prediction of Solar Flares**

## Purpose of the Project
Radiation from solar magnetic eruptions has the potential to disrupt telecommunications, power grids, navigation systems, and satellites. These eruptions often originate from active regions in the sun where concentrated areas of highly complex magnetic field configurations suddenly change. Active regions of the sun are currently characterized using the McIntosh classification system manually by experts in the field.

The magnetic field has been tracked using x-ray measurements from satellites GOES, SDO, SORCE, and TIMED as well as line-of-sight magnetograms from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG). Given the increase in the amount of data, we believe that the McIntosh classification system and the prediction and characterization of the solar magnetic eruptions may be improved by utilizing this large dataset and machine learning methods.
