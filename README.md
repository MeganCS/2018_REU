# REU Student Information 2018

Welcome to the 2018 REU Summer Student Program!

This repository was created to manage the work for the student project: 

**Machine Learning for the Prediction of Solar Flares**

*Solar Dynamics Observatory*

## Purpose of the Project
Radiation from solar magnetic eruptions has the potential to disrupt telecommunications, power grids, navigation systems, and satellites. These eruptions often originate from active regions in the sun where concentrated areas of highly complex magnetic field configurations suddenly change. Active regions of the sun are currently characterized using the McIntosh classification system manually by experts in the field. This is an arduous and subjective task.

Given the increase in the amount of satellite data, we believe that the McIntosh classification system and the prediction and characterization of the solar magnetic eruptions may be improved by utilizing this large dataset and machine learning methods.

The proposed REU student summer project will strive to automate the McIntosh classification. The exploration of the the trends seen in the dataset using an ensemble machine learning method will produce results that will be ultimately be integrated into neural network modeling. 

## Timeline: TBD

There is a lot to do! Here is a rough idea of what to expect each week.

**Week 1**
**Week 2**
**Week 3**
**Week 4**
**Week 5**
**Week 6**
**Week 7**
